# FYP-Coding-2025
The following code demonstrates how to use the ESP8266 NodeMCU to collect temperature data from a DS18B20 sensor and send simulated Temperature and Resistance (R2) values to ThingSpeak. The code includes Wi-Fi connection management and a calibration adjustment for the temperature sensor and all the data also in this repository.
Trial 1 is the final coding that writen on the Appendix A
